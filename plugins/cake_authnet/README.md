rainauthnet
===========

Cakephp plugin to easily get auth.net functionality into your cakephp project. 
Lets try and keep changes for a certain version of cake isolated to a certain branch. So for example if you are making 
changes for a 1.2 project that those should go in a branch for this project called 1.2. This should make it easier for managing changes. 

DB
==========
Sql for the db is located in config/sql/schema.sql. In cakephp 2.x+ versions this should be a cakephp schema file but I could not find any support for an
earlier version. 

Put in authnet api credentails here. 
/config/local.php  (please keep local.default.php up to date with changes)
