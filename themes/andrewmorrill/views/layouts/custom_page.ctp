			<h2><b>Biography</b></h2>
			
			<img style="border: none;" src="images/Nov-Hike-Portrait.jpg" alt="Andrew Morrill">
			
			<p>Andrew C. Morrill is a self-taught large format wilderness photographer. He devotes the majority of his creative energy to the Utah landscape. The terrain varies wildly from the north down to the south, and never leaves Andrew disappointed. Born in Utah, Andrew has lived and traveled all over the mountain west, exposing him to the regenerating aspects of that region.</p>  
			<p>Andrew's passion for photography comes from the spiritual solace and peace he has experienced in nature. Having endured a difficult youth, Andrew has only felt truly at home when alone with God's creations. Photography has become Andrew's vehicle for understanding the spirituality in nature, and sharing it with others.

			<p>Andrew currently resides with his wife and daughter in Provo, Utah, where he is finishing a degree in computer science at Brigham Young University, while building his photography portfolio. </p>
			<h2><b>Photographic Philosophy</b></h2>
			<a href="http://andrewmorrill.com/photo.php?id=20&gallery=temples"><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 7px; margin-left: 2px;" src="photos/smallThumbs/Provo-Temple-Winter.png"/></a>

			<p>I seek images that will evoke an emotional response in the viewer and carry a deeper meaning than simply what's on paper. The goal is to find unique compositions and views that convey my own artistic voice while keeping the finished product in mind. Before I expose an image, I first try to understand the essence of the location I'm shooting, and then work to express that essence in every composition. A place is beautiful for reasons we do not always comprehend, and we sometimes take its elements out of context, lessening their power. Capturing an excellent image requires preparation and patience, but also the spontaneity and willingness to follow the light. When everything falls into place, powerful images can result.</p>
									
			
			<h2><b>Equipment</b></h2>

			<a name="largeFormat"></a>
			<p>For my photography, I use 4x5 and 5x7 film cameras (that means, for a 4x5, the film is actually four inches by five inches). These formats are called "large format." You may be familiar with images of Ansel Adams under a black hood, taking pictures with an accordion looking camera. He used one of the largest formats--8x10. Large format has many advantages which I will only mention briefly here (see below for more info): better tonality, greater focusing control, perspective control, and of course, the ability to print very large pictures that retain the highest detail possible. 
Large format is the perfect fit for my style of photography because it is conducive to slow, methodical work, and maximum image quality. </p>
		
			<h2><b>Why Large Format?</b></h2>
			<p>The image below shows the relative image pixel sizes of a few digital cameras, compared to large format 5x7 film. As you can see the 5x7 film captures by far the most image data.</p><p>Also notice that the web sized images on this site cannot come close to showing the actual detail available in a large print.</p><br/>
